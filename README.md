1. Whitebox deep learning - performed the colab tutorial : [https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-tensorflow-mnist#0]

2. Blackbox deep learning - Using Fast AI - Demonstration of cnn_learner for image classification, unet_learner for segmentation, text_classifier_learner for sentiment analysis, tabular_learner for decisiontree, collab_learner for ranking.

3. Finetune-GPT3 folder contains a script to scrap the required data in a proper gpt3 understandable format, front-end script (gradio) in the colab, datasets and screenshots showing the work.Trained and fine-tuned gpt-3 model on responses generated by chatgpt for our customized prompts related to generating emails for promoting/selling nutrition meals.  Documentation referred - [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning].

4. Demonstrating Broadcasting, ragged tensors, Named tensors, string tensors, sparse tensors using tensorflow and pytorch. Implemented binary search, linear search, insertion sort using tensorflow
5. Demonstrating advanced tensor flow primitives (2b_operations_numpy,2b_operations_tensorflow,2b_operations_pytorch)
