i - uses hyper parameter search space to select important features using keras tuner and trains model. The colab demonstrates the accuracy in predicting before and after keras tuner.
k_claasification_document uses newspaper20 dataset to test the accuracy in prediction on pre and post augmentation on dataset. uses nlpaug package for augmentation.
k_classification_audio uses dog and cat audio files and tests accuracy of classification on pre and post augmentation of data. data is augmented using augly package.
k_classification_video uses brush_hair videos and shoot_gun videos from hmdb51_org dataset and tests the accuracy of the model on pre and post data augmentation performed on videos using augly[video]
